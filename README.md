Imperial Calendar
A web-based calendar that displays the current date according to the Imperial Dating System used in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The Imperial Dating System divides years into fractions and categorizes them by millennia, with events classified by their proximity to Terra. This calendar converts the current Gregorian date into the Imperial format.
